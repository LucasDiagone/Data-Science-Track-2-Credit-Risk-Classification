# Data-Science-Track-2-Credit-Risk-Classification
Machine Learning project using Naive Bayes to classify credit risk as good or bad payer based on financial and personal data.

# 💳 Credit Risk Classification with Naive Bayes

This project aims to classify clients as **good** or **bad payers** based on personal and financial data using the **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm.

## 📁 Dataset

- `Credit.csv`: Historical data with known outcomes.
- `NovoCredit.csv`: New data to classify.

## 🔍 Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Identify and encode categorical variables.
3. **Train/Test Split**: Split data for model evaluation.
4. **Model Training**: Train a Naive Bayes model.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
6. **Prediction**: Apply the trained model to new client data.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Label Encoding (sklearn)
- Logistic Regression (optional comparison)

## 📊 Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`: preprocessing, model selection, metrics

## 📈 Result

This model helps automate credit risk classification using supervised learning techniques.
